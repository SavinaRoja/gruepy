# gruepy

A toolkit for creating terminal user interfaces. Compare to [`npyscreen`](https://code.google.com/p/npyscreen) and [`urwid`](https://github.com/wardi/urwid).

Perhaps little more than a project in self-education, hopefully someday useful.

Primary aims include: take full advantage of asynchronicitiy, use modern Python, add complexity slowly, don't get in over my head.
