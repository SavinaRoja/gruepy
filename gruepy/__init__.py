"""
gruepy is a framework for creating terminal user interfaces with ncurses.
Intended to be modern and highly customizable, suitable for both simple and
advanced projects.

gruepy is in early development. There have been no "releases" and it is not
"stable". At this point in time, do not trust that updates won't break your
application.

gruepy is currently developed using Python 3.4 and up, backwards compatibility
is a low concern.
